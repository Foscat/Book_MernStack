# Book_MernStack
This is my first full MERN stack app. It is deployed at https://pacific-fjord-66795.herokuapp.com/.

## What it does
Uses the googleBooks api to search for books baised on what the user puts into the input bar.
Once the search has been sent the response is all books that are relevent to the term entered. Results are filtered by relevance.
If a user thinks a book is good and reccoment it to others they can add that book to the saved books db. Once saved it can be seen on the saved books page.
